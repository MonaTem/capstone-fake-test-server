"Once upon a time there was a talking bear that loved to eat berries and fish.  One day he was out catching fish and rooting around for berries when he encountered the woodcutter.  The woodcutter was hungry and he thought Ah!  Fresh bear meat for dinner! He strung his bow and got ready to kill the bear."
"But the bear had other ideas.  He did not care to be dinner for anyone. The bear cried Go away and leave me alone...rooooaarr!!! He turned and lashed out at his persecutor."
"The bears pursuer turned and shot an arrow into the bear. The bear did not die right away, but he roared in pain and struck out at the human with his claws.  The human died on the spot.  No one lived happily ever after."
