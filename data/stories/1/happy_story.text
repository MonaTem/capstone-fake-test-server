"Once upon a time there was a talking bear that loved to eat berries and fish.  One day he was out catching fish and rooting around for berries when he encountered the woodcutter.  The woodcutter was hungry and he thought Ah!  Fresh bear meat for dinner! He strung his bow and got ready to kill the bear.""
"But the bear had other ideas.  He did not care to be dinner for anyone. The bear cried Go away and leave me alone...rooooaarr!!! He turned and lashed out at his persecutor."
"The bears pursuer took to his heels and ran away as fast as he could.  He ate a nice dinner at home.  The bear ambled away happily and resumed his fishing and berry hunting. Everyone lived happily ever after."
