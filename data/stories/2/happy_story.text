"Once upon a time there was a princess imprisoned inside a tree trunk."
"A witch, jealous of the princess's beauty and her long blonde hair, had tricked the princess, whose name was Arabella, into walking into the woods very late one night by turning into an owl, alighting on Arabella's window sill, and hooting.  Then when Arabella awoke, the witch/owl flew into the woods and turned back into a witch.  The mean witch then cast a spell that imprisoned the Princess inside a nearby tree trunk."
"No one heard the princess's cries for help or her knocking on the inside of the tree, except a frog.  The frog, named Marvin, went and found his buddy the bear who was very strong.  The bear ripped open the tree and pulled the Princess out.  Then he turned into a handsome prince and married the princess.  Everyone lived happily ever after, even the witch, who turned into a frog and married Marvin."
