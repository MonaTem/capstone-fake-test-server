Once upon a time, there was a Princess who was in love with a Bear.  The Bear had long red hair and so did the Princess.
One day the Bear met a beautiful female bear in a lavender dress and matching cape. He fell in love with her.  The Bear forgot about the Princess and married the female bear.  The bears lived happily ever after.
The Princess was very, very sad and lonely.  She cried herself to sleep.
