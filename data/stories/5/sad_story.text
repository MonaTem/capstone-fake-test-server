"Once upon a time there was a Fairy who loved an elf.  The elf mostly ignored her as he was kind of stuck on himself and mostly ignored everyone else."
"The Fairy started pining away as she was really crazy about the elf who barely noticed her.  She lost weight, didn't eat, and became listless and pale (well, paler, she was pale to begin with)."
"The elf went away to war and never even said anything to the Fairy.  The Fairy was never the same again.  She lost her joy.  No one lived happily ever after (including the elf, who was shot by an arrow.)"
