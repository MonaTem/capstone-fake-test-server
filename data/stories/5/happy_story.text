"Once upon a time there was a Fairy who loved casting spells to create beautiful shiny gossamer objects like dragonflies and spiderwebs and other indescribable stuff."
"The Fairy decided she needed a special steed to travel to distant lands outside of Fairyland.  So she cast an extra special spell and created an amazing giant dragonfly with translucent opalescent wings in rainbow colors. "
"The Fairy hopped on her gorgeous giant dragonfly and flew it to the Elfin Lands, where she lived happily ever after."
