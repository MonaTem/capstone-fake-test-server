"Once upon a time there was a sweet Witch who liked people and animals.  But people assumed that all Witches were wicked so they ran away whenever they saw her.  This made the Witch sad and lonely, as all she wanted was to make friends."
"One day, the Witch was sitting in her little house in the woods feeling very lonely when there was a loud knock on the door.  When the Witch opened the door, she saw a little girl and her puppy.   The little girl said in a little voice, 'My mother told me never to speak to strangers, especially witches, but I'm completely lost in these woods, so I have no choice.  Please don't bake me and my puppy in an oven.' "
"The Witch felt a bit insulted at first, but the girl and her puppy looked so forlorn, that the Witch put her feelings aside and welcomed them into her hut.  She gave the child cookies that she'd baked and made dog biscuits for the puppy.   Then she took them home to the girl's worried parents, who were overjoyed that their daughter was safe.  From then on, everyone knew that the Witch was nice. The Witch made lots of friends. Everyone lived happily ever after."
