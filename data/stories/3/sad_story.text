"Once upon a time there was a very nasty Witch who ate puppies, kittens, and children as snacks."
"Two children and their dog came calling on the Witch with their dog.  She tried to put them all in her oven."
"But the children pushed the Witch into the oven and ran away.  The kids lived happily ever after, but that was the end of that wicked Witch and her house burned down too."
