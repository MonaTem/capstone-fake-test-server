"Once upon a time there was a Woodcutter who lived in a cottage in the woods.  He was enjoying a nice dinner when there was a loud banging on his door."
"He opened the door and there stood and Ogre holding a troll upside down by the heels.  The troll was squirming and shouting, 'Hey, you dumb Woodcutter, are you going to help me or are you going to just stand there and stare?'"
"The Woodcutter got mad and slammed the door.  He heard a lot of snarling and screaming and scratching outside the door and in the morning he found a dead Ogre and a passed out troll lying in a heap on his doorstep.  No one lived happily ever after."
