"Once upon a time there was a Woodcutter who lived in a cottage in the woods.  He was enjoying a nice dinner when there was a loud banging on his door."
"A beautiful Princess stood in his doorway crying.  The Woodcutter invited her into his cottage, and sat her down by his nice roaring fire.  'How can I help?' the Woodcutter inquired."  The Princess sobbed, "My dog Fifi has run away!  Can you help me find her"
"Then there was a scratching noise at the door and a doggy whine.  The Woodcutter let in the sopping wet, rainy dog, who immediately shook herself and got water all over the Woodcutter's nice upholstered chairs.  The Woodcutter snarled at the stupid dog, but the Princess was overjoyed and the dog leaped into her arms.  The Woodcutter smiled and decided it was time for new chairs anyway.  Everyone lived happily ever after."
