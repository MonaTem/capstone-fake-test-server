"Once upon a time there was an Ogre who loved chocolate, animal crackers, and peanuts.  He was also fond of children, ponies, and kittens. He was a gentle soul, but since he was big and scary looking, people (especially children) were afraid of him.
"When the Ogre came striding into a place, he would scare people and they'd run away or hide.  This made the Ogre sad as all he wanted was someone to play with."
"Then one day the Ogre rescued a terrified kitten from a Witch that had captured it.  The Ogre found a cave and made a bed from soft blankets there.  The kitten purred and was happy, warm, and safe.  The Ogre had found a friend, so he was happy too.  Everyone lived happily ever after."
