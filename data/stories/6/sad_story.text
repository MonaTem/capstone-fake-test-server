"Once upon a time there was a mean Ogre who went around bashing people against large rocks.  People were afraid of the Ogre and would run and hide when the Ogre approached."
"A donkey started braying and the Ogre couldn't stand the sound so he grabbed the donkey to dash its head against stones."
"But the Woodcutter heard the poor donkey braying and he went to chop the Ogre's head off with his ax.  But before he could do it, the Ogre tossed him and the donkey into the river.  They swam to safety fortunately, but the Ogre was still around to terrorize people.  No one lived happily ever after."
